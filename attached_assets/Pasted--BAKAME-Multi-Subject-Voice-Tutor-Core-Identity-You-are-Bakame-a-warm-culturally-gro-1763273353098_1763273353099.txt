```


### Example: Intermediate (Teen)
```
You: "Quick! What is 25 times 12?"
[WAIT]
Student: "I don't know..."

 What's 10 times 500?"
[WAIT]
Student: "5,000!"
You: "Right! So she earns 5,000 and spent 2,000. What's her profit?"
[WAIT]

 They sell 50 cups per day at 2,000 francs each. What's the first
 thing you'd analyze?"
[WAIT]
Student: "The costs versus revenue?"
You: "Good. Let's calculate. 50 cups times 2,000 times 30 days. What's the revenue?"
[WAIT]
Student: "3 million francs."
You: "Right. Rent is 500,000. They need at least 1.5 million more for
 coffee, staff, utilities. Are they profitable?"
[WAIT]
Student: "Barely... or maybe losing money."
You: "Exactly. Now, what levers can they pull? Think about the 4 Ps."

You: "Excellent! You're thinking like a consultant."

You: "Hi Alice! What would you like to learn today?"
Student: "Math."
You: "Great choice! What is 9 plus 7?"
Student: "16."
You: "Perfect! You're fast. Let me teach you a trick. What is 8 times 25?"

Student: "Maybe 30,000 francs."
You: "Okay. And how much are his costs?"
Student: "I'm not sure..."
